# Mortgage Credit Risk — PD, LGD, EAD, Expected Loss & Stress Testing

An end-to-end IRB-style credit-risk model for a US residential-mortgage portfolio: probability
of default (**PD**), loss given default (**LGD**), exposure at default (**EAD**), Expected Loss
(**EL = PD × LGD × EAD**), IFRS 9 / AASB 9 staging, and two methods of stress testing.

Built on the Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset: **~850,000 loans across 17
origination vintages (2006–2022)**, observed monthly through 2025-09 — a full cycle covering the
2007–2009 financial crisis, the recovery, and the 2020 COVID shock. All models are interpretable
and every result is reproduced by the pipeline into [outputs/tables/](outputs/tables/).

## Methods used (summary)

| Component | Method |
|---|---|
| **PD** | Logistic regression on origination features → WOE/IV points scorecard → 8 rating grades (A–H). Grades calibrated to a count-weighted long-run one-year default rate; margin of conservatism; revise-upward ratchet; 5 bps floor. |
| **LGD** | Two-stage ("hurdle") model on settled-loss data: **Stage 1 logistic regression** (probability of a loss) × **Stage 2 linear regression** (loss severity). Economic-discounted and APRA-capital variants; downturn LGD. |
| **EAD** | Outstanding balance at default. Supervisory EAD — no credit-conversion factor (a term mortgage has no undrawn limit). |
| **EL** | EL = PD × LGD × EAD per loan, using the calibrated capital PD; IFRS 9 / AASB 9 Stage 1/2/3. |
| **Stress — method A** | Observed downturn multipliers (GFC and COVID) applied to PD and LGD. |
| **Stress — method B** | Macro-credit "satellite" model: two macro regressions — quarterly default rate → stressed PD (per grade, with migration) and quarterly LGD → stressed LGD. |
| **Validation** | Discrimination (AUC/Gini/KS), calibration plot, binomial + Hosmer-Lemeshow test, confusion matrix, out-of-time and forward cold holdout, PSI. LGD: loss reconciliation, cohort backtest, segment calibration, benchmarking. |

## Results (summary)

| Period (origination) | One-year default rate | Realised LGD | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GFC crisis (2006–2008) | 7–14% | 54–58% | high default and high severity |
| Recovery (2009–2014) | ~2% | 34–42% | low default, easing severity |
| Calm expansion (2015–2019) | 2–4% | 18–25% | baseline conditions |
| COVID-2020 | 1.2% (forbearance-suppressed) | ~27% | high default risk, mild severity |

- **PD:** held-out AUC 0.83 / Gini 0.65 / KS 0.50; passes a forward cold holdout (train 2006–2019, score the never-seen 2020–2022 loans).
- **LGD:** computed loss reconciles to Freddie Mac's own loss field at 0.99 correlation; GFC downturn LGD ~56.5% vs ~34% outside it.
- **EL:** portfolio 12-month EL ~$236m (12.3 bps of $192bn exposure), rising to ~$323m under IFRS 9 lifetime staging.
- **Stress:** a severe GFC scenario lifts EL ~13× (PD ×5.7, LGD ×2.3); the observed COVID-2020 shape lifts it ~4.7× (PD ×4.3, LGD ×1.1).

## 1. Data and inputs

**Coverage.** 17 origination vintages, 2006–2022 (2005 is not in the public sample set), 50,000
loans each (~850,000 total), with monthly performance observed through 2025-09. The one-year PD
window is therefore fully observable for every vintage, including 2022.

**Source.** Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset (SFLLD) — public US fixed-rate,
fully-amortising single-family loans. Two header-less pipe-delimited files per vintage: an
**origination** file (one row per loan) and a **monthly performance** file (one row per
loan-month, tens of millions of rows). Raw data is **not** redistributed in this repo.
Source: <https://freddiemac.com/research/datasets/sf-loanlevel-dataset>

**Key raw variables.**

| Origination file | Monthly performance file |
|---|---|
| `credit_score`, `original_ltv`, `original_cltv`, `original_dti` | `monthly_reporting_period`, `loan_age` |
| `original_upb` (loan amount), `original_interest_rate` | `current_actual_upb` (running balance) |
| `original_loan_term`, `number_of_borrowers` | `current_loan_delinquency_status` |
| `loan_purpose`, `occupancy_status`, `channel` | `zero_balance_code`, `zero_balance_effective_date` |
| `property_type`, `property_state`, `mi_pct` | `net_sales_proceeds`, `mi_recoveries`, `non_mi_recoveries` |
| | `expenses`, `delinquent_accrued_interest`, `actual_loss_calculation` |

**Cleaning, transformation, feature engineering.**

- **Layout assertion** — the 32-column SFLLD layout is applied in [src/layout.py](src/layout.py)
  and the column count is asserted before any names are attached, preventing a silent mis-mapping.
- **Sentinel handling** — SFLLD missing codes → NA (`credit_score` 9999, `original_dti` 999,
  `original_cltv`/`original_ltv` 999); delinquency text codes (`R`/`RA` for REO) parsed to numbers,
  blanks/`XX` → NA; money fields carrying letters (`C`/`U`) stripped before arithmetic.
- **Loss-field correction** — the aggregate `expenses` field equals the sum of its four
  sub-components and all are stored negative; adding them double-counts costs. Using the aggregate
  once, with the correct sign, makes the computed loss reconcile to `actual_loss_calculation` at
  0.99 correlation (notebook 01).
- **Collapse to loan level** — the monthly file is reduced to one row per loan: default flag and
  date, balance at default, one-time loss/recovery components.
- **Engineered fields** — `default_within_12m` (one-year PD target), `ever_default` (lifetime),
  realised / economic / APRA LGD, EAD, a regime classifier (GFC 2006–09 / COVID 2020 / calm), and a
  WOE/IV transform for the scorecard. → [00_data_quality.csv](outputs/tables/00_data_quality.csv)

## 2. PD model

Estimates the 12-month probability that a loan defaults.

**Method.**

- **Default definition** — first month at 180+ days past due (delinquency status ≥ 6) **or** a
  credit-event zero-balance code (third-party sale, short sale/charge-off, REO disposition, note
  sale). Prepaid/matured loans are not defaults. A 90-DPD variant is also computed for the APS 220
  broad-equivalence check.
- **Target** — `default_within_12m`: default within the first 12 months of the loan's life (a fixed
  window, so all 17 vintages are comparable; CRE36.63 / APS 113 Att D PD para 2).
- **Model** — logistic regression on origination features only (a through-the-door scorecard),
  features standardised before fitting.
- **Scorecard** — the logistic score is converted to a WOE/IV points scorecard and loans are sorted
  into 8 rating grades (A safest → H riskiest).
- **Calibration** — each grade is calibrated to its **count-weighted long-run** one-year default
  rate across the 17 vintages, then adjusted by a **risk-sensitive margin of conservatism**, a
  **revise-upward ratchet** (lifts any grade whose realised rate exceeds the prediction; APS 113
  Validation para 6), and the **5 bps regulatory floor**.

**Coefficients** (standardised; `exp(coef)` = odds multiplier per 1 SD)
→ [03_pd_coefficients.csv](outputs/tables/03_pd_coefficients.csv):

| Variable | Coefficient | Odds ×/1 SD | Direction |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| intercept | −6.30 | — | base rate ~0.4% |
| credit_score | −0.64 | 0.53 | higher score → lower default (strongest driver) |
| original_dti | +0.37 | 1.45 | higher debt-to-income → higher default |
| original_interest_rate | +0.33 | 1.39 | higher (risk-priced) rate → higher default |
| original_loan_term | +0.29 | 1.34 | longer term → higher default |
| original_ltv | +0.23 | 1.26 | higher loan-to-value → higher default |
| original_cltv | +0.14 | 1.15 | higher combined LTV → higher default |
| loan_purpose / occupancy / channel | ±0.09 or less | ~1.0 | small categorical adjustments |

All signs are economically consistent: credit score dominates and is protective; leverage
(LTV/CLTV), affordability (DTI) and price (rate) increase default odds.

**Rating grades — master scale** (predicted vs observed default rate per grade)
→ [03b_master_scale.csv](outputs/tables/03b_master_scale.csv):

| H | 109,271 | 1.22% | 1.17% | 1.09% |

Predicted and observed rates rise monotonically and align closely — the scorecard both ranks and
sizes risk. Grades G and H are flagged by the binomial calibration test and ratcheted up to their
realised rate. → [03d_pd_calibration_test.csv](outputs/tables/03d_pd_calibration_test.csv) ·

## 3. LGD model

Estimates, given default, the fraction of EAD that is lost.

**Loss definition.** Economic loss ÷ EAD, computed from settled-loss records (not assumed).
Realised loss = `EAD + delinquent accrued interest − expenses − (net sales proceeds + MI recoveries
+ non-MI recoveries)`, capped to `[0, 1.10]`. This reconciles to Freddie Mac's own loss field at 0.99
correlation. The model is built only on **defaulted, disposed (fully resolved) loans** — the loans
with a realised loss. Drivers: original LTV, credit score, loan size (UPB), and a GFC-downturn
indicator. "Material loss" means LGD > 5%.

**Why a two-stage ("hurdle") model.** Realised LGD has a large **spike at zero**: many mortgage
defaults cure or are resolved with little or no loss, while the rest produce a continuous severity. A
single regression cannot fit both that lump of zeros and the continuous tail at once, so the model
splits the problem into two questions and **multiplies** the answers:

| Stage | Question | Outcome type | Model used | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Does a material loss occur at all? | binary (yes / no) | **logistic regression** | `P(loss)` — probability a loss occurs |
| 2 | How big is the loss, given one occurs? | continuous 0–100% | **linear regression** (loss-only loans) | `severity` — expected loss size |

**Why two *different* model types.** The two stages answer different kinds of question, so they need
different models. Stage 1 is a **binary event** (loss / no loss), which is exactly what **logistic
regression** is for — it outputs a probability. Stage 2 is a **continuous fraction** (0–100%), which
needs a **linear regression** — a logistic regression cannot output a continuous loss size, and a
single linear model fitted across *all* defaults would be distorted by the mass of zero-loss cases.

**The final LGD** is the **product of the two models**, computed per loan:

> **LGD = P(loss) × severity**

i.e. (probability a loss happens) × (expected size if it does). For example, a loan with
`P(loss) = 0.80` and `severity = 0.70` has **LGD = 0.56**. This per-loan expected LGD is what feeds
Expected Loss (§5); averaged over the disposed defaults it gives the regime figures below.

**Other LGD views.**

- **Economic (discounted)** LGD (`lgd_econ`) — the recovery discounted from disposition back to
  default; and an **APRA capital view** (`lgd_apra`: MI recoveries excluded, 20% high-LVR reduction,
  20% floor), kept separate from the IFRS 9 figures.
- **Downturn LGD** — severity is cyclical (GFC ≈ 1.6× the rest), so the downturn LGD is used for
  capital/EL (APS 113 Att D LGD paras 4–5). An incomplete-workout sensitivity covers unresolved
  recent defaults.

**Coefficients and key drivers** → [04_lgd_coefficients.csv](outputs/tables/04_lgd_coefficients.csv):

| Stage (regression) | Variable | Coefficient | Reading |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 — P(loss), logistic | downturn flag | +1.61 | dominant driver — a GFC-era default is far more likely to crystallise a loss |
| | original_ltv | +0.009 | higher LTV → more likely a loss |
| | credit_score | +0.001 | small |
| 2 — severity, linear | downturn flag | +0.18 | a GFC-era loss is ~18 LGD-points more severe |
| | original_ltv | −0.0004 | small |
| | credit_score | −0.0003 | small |

The dominant driver of severity is the downturn/collateral environment, not the individual
borrower — the cyclical signature a downturn LGD is meant to capture.

**Predicted LGD by regime** → [04_lgd_model.csv](outputs/tables/04_lgd_model.csv):

| Regime | Disposed defaults | Observed LGD | Modelled LGD | Economic LGD | APRA-view LGD |

| downturn (GFC) | 11,222 | 56.5% | 56.5% | 61.9% | 63.2% |

## 4. EAD model

Estimates the amount owed at the moment of default.

**Method.**

- **Definition** — the outstanding balance at default (`current_actual_upb` at the first default
  month, plus any deferred balance; falling back to the balance removed at disposition where the
  credit-event row shows zero).
- **No credit-conversion factor (CCF)** — a term mortgage is fully drawn at origination and has no
  undrawn limit, so there is nothing to convert. This is supervisory EAD; own-EAD estimates are
  mandatory only for revolving retail (e.g. credit cards). EAD is floored at the current drawn
  balance, and post-default drawings are assigned to LGD, not EAD.

**Results** → [05_ead_summary.csv](outputs/tables/05_ead_summary.csv): mean EAD rises from ~$179k
(2006) to ~$295k (2022), tracking house-price growth rather than risk; portfolio exposure base
~$192bn. In Expected Loss, the exposure used per loan is the balance at default if the loan
defaulted, otherwise the original loan amount.

---

## 5. Expected Loss

`EL = PD × LGD × EAD`, computed per loan and summed. The PD used is the **calibrated capital grade
PD** (long-run average + margin of conservatism + ratchet + floor), so EL reconciles to the master
scale. Loans are sorted into IFRS 9 / AASB 9 stages — Stage 1 (performing, 12-month ECL), Stage 2
(significant increase in risk, lifetime ECL), Stage 3 (defaulted, lifetime ECL on a best-estimate
basis).

**By rating grade and portfolio total** → [06_el_summary_by_grade.csv](outputs/tables/06_el_summary_by_grade.csv):

| Grade | Loans | Total EAD | Avg PD | Avg LGD | 12-mo Expected Loss | EL rate (bps) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A | 98,247 | $21.4bn | 0.05% | 33.8% | $3.1m | 1.4 |
| B | 114,153 | $25.9bn | 0.08% | 33.2% | $5.8m | 2.2 |
| C | 105,933 | $25.0bn | 0.11% | 33.6% | $7.8m | 3.1 |
| D | 106,462 | $24.7bn | 0.22% | 34.3% | $15.8m | 6.4 |
| E | 105,591 | $24.6bn | 0.40% | 35.3% | $29.2m | 11.9 |
| F | 106,384 | $22.5bn | 0.43% | 36.6% | $30.2m | 13.4 |
| G | 103,959 | $23.3bn | 0.71% | 36.7% | $52.0m | 22.3 |
| H | 109,271 | $24.8bn | 1.17% | 36.7% | $92.1m | 37.1 |
| **PORTFOLIO** | **850,000** | **$192.3bn** | **0.40%** | **35.0%** | **$235.9m** | **12.3** |

The EL rate rises 1.4 → 37 bps from A to H, driven by PD; LGD is broadly flat across grades because
severity is collateral/cycle-driven, not borrower-grade-driven.

**By IFRS 9 stage** → [06_expected_loss.csv](outputs/tables/06_expected_loss.csv):

| Stage | Loans | Avg PD | Avg LGD | Total EAD | 12-month EL | Reported ECL (staged) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 — performing | 790,987 | low | 35% | $180.2bn | $206.8m | $206.8m (12-month) |
| 2 — significant ↑ in risk | 26,205 | — | 38% | $5.5bn | $11.3m | $45.2m (lifetime) |
| 3 — defaulted | 32,808 | — | 44% | $6.5bn | $17.8m | $71.2m (lifetime) |

Portfolio 12-month EL ≈ $236m, rising to ≈ $323m once IFRS 9 lifetime ECL applies to Stages 2 and 3.

## 6. Stress testing

A stress test asks: **if the economy deteriorates, how much does Expected Loss rise?** Each method
below turns a recession scenario into a **stressed PD** and a **stressed LGD**, then recomputes
**EL = PD × LGD × EAD**. Both stack the PD and LGD shocks with no diversification offset (APG 113
para 92) and cover at least a mild recession (Basel CRE36.51). Two methods are implemented:

- **Method A — observed multipliers** (notebook 07): the simple approach — multiply the baseline PD
  and LGD by ratios read directly from the data.
- **Method B — macro-credit "satellite" model** ([stress_test/](stress_test/)): the statistical
  approach — **two regressions on the macro variables**, one predicting the default rate (→ stressed
  PD) and one predicting LGD (→ stressed LGD), so a recession scenario produces the stressed
  parameters through fitted coefficients, not assumed multipliers.

### 6.1 Method A — observed multipliers

Read the downturn multipliers straight from the data (the ratio of the GFC and COVID default rate and
LGD to the calm-period values) and apply them to the baseline PD and LGD.
→ [07_stress_test.csv](outputs/tables/07_stress_test.csv):

| Scenario | PD multiplier | LGD multiplier | EL uplift |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| severe (GFC) | ×5.7 | ×2.3 | ~13× |
| COVID-2020 (observed) | ×4.3 | ×1.1 | ~4.7× |

### 6.2 Method B — macro-credit satellite model (stressed PD)

The core is one **logistic regression that takes the macro variables as inputs and predicts the
default rate**:

```text
logit(default rate) = α + β₁·unemployment + β₂·house-price growth + β₃·GDP growth + (seasoning control)
```

It is fitted on **79 quarters (2006Q1–2025Q3)**, pairing each quarter's observed default rate with
that quarter's macro (the join below). To stress the book, a recession's macro values are plugged into
this fitted equation, which then outputs a **higher predicted default rate — the stressed PD**. The
macro variables therefore drive PD through the estimated coefficients, not through an assumed factor.

**Where the macro data comes from.** The macro drivers are an external overlay of public US series
(they are not in the loan data, which supplies the default rate), held in
[stress_test/macro/macro_annual.csv](stress_test/macro/macro_annual.csv):

| Driver | Source (FRED series) |
|---|---|
| unemployment rate (%) | `UNRATE` |
| house-price growth YoY (%) | `CSUSHPINSA` (Case-Shiller) |
| real GDP growth (%) | `A191RL1Q225SBEA` |
| 30-yr mortgage rate (%) | `MORTGAGE30US` |

Committed values are approximate public figures (so the pipeline runs offline);
[fetch_macro_fred.py](stress_test/fetch_macro_fred.py) refreshes them from FRED.

**How the macro data enters the regression — a calendar-time join.**

```text
macro_annual.csv ──interpolate to quarterly──┐
                                             merge on calendar quarter ──► fit  logit(default rate)
loan_level.parquet ──quarterly default rate──┘                                  ~ β·[unemp, ΔHPI, GDP, age]
```

1. interpolate the annual macro to quarterly;
2. build a quarterly point-in-time default rate from the loan panel;
3. join the two by calendar quarter (so bad macro aligns with high observed default);
4. standardise the drivers and **fit the logistic regression** → the satellite coefficients;
5. for a scenario, plug its (clipped-to-support) macro values back in → stressed default rate.

**Coefficients** (standardised; `mortgage_rate` excluded for a perverse sign): unemployment **+0.97**
(dominant), house-price growth −0.18, GDP growth −0.12, seasoning control +0.50 — all economically
correct. → [satellite_coefficients.csv](stress_test/outputs/tables/satellite_coefficients.csv)

**Stressed PD per rating grade + migration.** A scenario's macro effect is a single **log-odds shift**
(mild +1.70, severe +3.24) added to each grade's base PD —
`logit(stressed PD_grade) = logit(base PD_grade) + macro_shift` — and each stressed PD is mapped back to
the master scale to show migration → [scenario_stressed_pd_by_grade.csv](stress_test/outputs/tables/scenario_stressed_pd_by_grade.csv):

| Grade | Base PD | Mild → PD (migrates to) | Severe → PD (migrates to) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A | 0.05% | 0.27% (→ D) | 1.26% (→ H) |
| C | 0.11% | 0.60% (→ G) | 2.74% (→ H+) |
| E | 0.40% | 2.14% (→ H+) | 9.31% (→ H+) |
| H | 1.17% | 6.06% (→ H+) | 23.2% (→ H+) |

The severe satellite PD (×24.7 vs baseline) is a **simultaneous-shock upper bound** — it assumes peak
unemployment and a house-price crash at once, worse than any single observed quarter — so it is
triangulated against the observed ceiling (×7.8) and method A (×5.7). See
[stress_test/README.md](stress_test/README.md) for the model-risk controls.

### 6.3 Method B — LGD satellite (stressed LGD)

LGD is stressed by its **own** macro regression, parallel to the PD satellite. The quarterly mean
realised LGD — taken by **disposition quarter**, since severity is realised when the collateral is
sold — is regressed on macro:

```text
logit(LGD) = α + β₁·unemployment + β₂·house-price growth

fitted on **59 disposition quarters (2008–2025)**. House prices are the key driver: when prices fall,
recoveries shrink and LGD rises. **Coefficients** (standardised; `gdp_growth` excluded for a perverse
sign): unemployment **+0.23**, house-price growth **−0.16** — both economically correct (R² 0.44).

The regression's macro-driven **LGD multiplier vs baseline** is applied to the measured baseline LGD
(§3), so the level stays anchored to the settled-loss data while the sensitivity comes from the
regression:

| Scenario | Worst ΔHPI | LGD multiplier | Stressed LGD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| baseline | +5% | ×1.0 | 0.34 |
| mild recession | −4% | ×1.34 | 0.46 |
| severe (GFC-like) | −7% | ×1.57 | 0.53 |

The severe ~0.53 is close to the directly-measured GFC downturn LGD of ~0.56 — the regression and the
realised data agree.

### 6.4 Stressed Expected Loss

Combining the stressed parameters, **stressed EL = stressed PD × stressed LGD × EAD**, with the PD and
LGD shocks stacking (no diversification offset). Under **method A** a severe GFC scenario lifts
portfolio EL **~13×** and the observed COVID shape **~4.7×** (§6.1). Under **method B** (both satellite
regressions) the same severe scenario combines the PD shift (§6.2) with the LGD multiplier ×1.57
(§6.3); the headline uplift is larger because the satellite PD is the simultaneous-shock upper bound
(triangulated in §6.2). → [scenario_stressed_el.csv](stress_test/outputs/tables/scenario_stressed_el.csv)

## Regulatory alignment (APS 113 / APG 113 / Basel / WP14 / IFRS 9)

The per-component sections state where each rule is applied. In summary: a one-year PD calibrated to
a count-weighted long-run average with a margin of conservatism and the 5 bps floor; economic and
downturn LGD with the APRA floor/MI rules kept separate from IFRS 9; supervisory EAD (no CCF) for a
term product; EL on the same PD as capital, staged under IFRS 9; and a credit-risk stress test
(observed multipliers plus a satellite model) covering at least a mild recession with the
no-diversification assumption. The 17-vintage 2006–2022 window meets the 5-year PD/retail-LGD
minimum. Items documented as out of scope (notebook 08): rating philosophy, override policy, use
test, development/validation independence, cure/probation rules, the 180-vs-90-DPD equivalence, a
full lifetime-PD term structure (a horizon-factor proxy is used), and the recent-vintage
incomplete-workout caveat.

## Limitations

- Demonstration model, not a certified regulatory-capital calculation; the APRA-view overlays are
  illustrative applications of the rules.
- US agency mortgages, not an Australian / APRA IRB portfolio.
- Sample data (50k loans/vintage, ~850k total); illustrative calibration.
- The satellite stress test extrapolates in the joint tail (severe scenario), so its severe figure is
  an upper bound and is triangulated.
- Recent-vintage (2021–2022) LGD workouts are not yet fully resolved (incomplete-workout caveat).

## How to run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Place the SFLLD samples under "data/raw data/" — either as sample_orig_YYYY.txt +
# sample_svcg_YYYY.txt directly, or in per-vintage sample_YYYY/ subfolders (both work),
# for origination years 2006–2022.
python build_notebooks.py     # (re)generate the notebooks
python run_notebooks.py all   # execute 00–08; writes tables to outputs/tables/
python tools/make_figures.py  # regenerate the charts
cd stress_test && python build_stress.py   # statistical satellite stress test (method B)
```

Notebook 00 assembles all 17 vintages once (~10 min) and caches a loan-level table; the rest run in
seconds off the cache.
